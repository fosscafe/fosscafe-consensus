<h1>Glossary</h1>
<p><a class="entry" name="agreement"><b>Agreement:</b></a>
See <a href="#consensus">Consensus</a>.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="asynchronous"><b>Asynchronous Environment:</b></a>
In an asynchronous environment there are no bounds on timing. In an asynchronous
environment clocks run arbitrarily fast, network communication takes
arbitrarily long, and <a href="#sm">state machines</a> take
arbitrarily long to transition in response to an operation. Because there is no bound on timing for
delivering and processing messages, it is impossible for other
processes to know for certain that a process has failed or is being
very very slow. The term &#8220;asynchronous&#8221; as used in the
context of Paxos should not be confused with non-blocking operations
on objects; they are often called asynchronous as well.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="availability"><b>Availability:</b></a> A
request that is sent to a machine in a distributed system may become
idle if the machine is unavailable for any reason. In the worst case,
the request can be delayed until the problem is fixed or the faulty
machine is replaced by a replica. Availability is the ability of a
distributed system to limit this latency as much as possible. For a
distributed system to be available, it should also
be <a href="#reliability">reliable</a>.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="bf"><b>Byzantine Failure:</b></a>
A <a href="#sm">state machine</a> has experienced a byzantine failure
if it behaved in an arbitrary manner, which includes sending fake
messages, not sending any messages, trying to disrupt the computation,
corrupting their local state and processing requests incorrectly among
other unspecified transitions. <a href="#paxos">Paxos</a> does not
solve the <a href="#consensus">consensus</a> problem in the existence of byzantine
failures.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="consensus"><b>Consensus:</b></a> In the
consensus problem, each process proposes some initial value, and
processes that do not fail must reach an irrevocable decision on
exactly one of the proposed values. The consensus problem captures an
essential component of replication in distributed systems: the fact
that replicas (processes) need to agree on the next state transition
they handle, so that they can remain in identical
states. <a href="#paxos">Paxos</a> solves the consensus problem in an
asynchronous environment, where processes can crash.  But Paxos (much
like any other consensus protocol) is limited by
the <a href="#flp">FLP Impossibility Result</a> in its ability to
reach consensus in an asynchronous environment where processes can crash.
</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="consistency"><b>Consistency:</b></a>
Distributed systems replicate shared state to improve fault tolerance,
data availability and performance.  However, if the updates to this
state are not carefully controlled, the state on different replicas
might diverge over time creating inconsistency between replicas. In
this case two clients that read the state from two different replicas
might see two different states. To prevent this every distributed
system supports a consistency model, i.e. employs a protocol that
supports a consistency model. Different consistency models offer
different consistency guarantees, but as long as the user follows the
rules associated with a consistency model, the distributed system
guarantees that the user will not observe any inconsistencies. The
most intuitive type of consistency is strong consistency. A protocol
supports strong consistency, if all state changes are seen by all
distributed processes in the same order, sequentially.
<a href="#paxos">Paxos</a> supports strong consistency.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="cf"><b>Crash Failure:</b></a>
A <a href="#sm">state machine</a> has experienced a crash failure if
it will make no more transitions and thus its current state is fixed
indefinitely. A crashed state machine does not make unspecified
transitions. For machines that make unspecified transitions,
see <a href="#bf">Byzantine failures</a>.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="dsm"><b>Deterministic State Machine:</b></a>
In a deterministic state machine for any state and operation, the
transition enabled by the operation is unique and the output is a
function only of the state and the operation. Logically, a
deterministic state machine handles one operation at a time.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="fs"><b>Fail-Stop:</b></a> A
machine <a href="#cf">crash</a> is fail-stop if other machines can
detect reliably that the process has crashed. In
an <a href="#asynchronous">asynchronous</a> environment, one machine
cannot tell whether another machine is slow or has crashed.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="ft"><b>Fault Tolerance:</b></a>
See <a href="#reliability"> Reliability</a>.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="flp"><b>FLP Impossibility Result:</b></a>
&#8220;Consensus problem is not solvable in an asynchronous
system.&#8221; The result has been established by
Fischer-Lynch-Paterson, hence the name FLP. The result states that
there exists no deterministic algorithm that
solves <a href="#consensus">consensus</a> in
an <a href="#asynchronous">asynchronous</a> environment with reliable
channels if one single process may <a href="#cf">crash</a>. This is
due to the fact that in an asynchronous environment it is impossible
to detect if a process has crashed or is very very slow. The basic
idea behind the proof presented in
the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/pods83-flp.pdf"
target="_blank">FLP paper</a> is to show circumstances under which the
protocol remains forever indecisive.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="majority"><b>Majority:</b></a>
See <a href="#quorum">Quorum</a>.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="paxos"><b>Paxos:</b></a>
A <a href="#consensus">consensus</a> protocol for <a href="#smr">state
machine replication</a> in an <a href="#asynchronous">asynchronous</a>
environment that admits <a href="#cf">crash failures</a>.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="quorum"><b>Quorum:</b></a> One way of
achieving <a href="#consensus">consensus</a> in a distributed system is using voting. A quorum
is the minimum number of votes that a replica has to obtain in order
to be allowed to perform a state transition in a distributed
system. There are two rules about determining quorums in a distributed
system. First, any two quorums must intersect in at least one
process. Second, at least one of the quorums (which ones is unknown)
contains processes that never crash. This guarantees that if a replica
received votes from a quorum there will always be at least one process
that voted for the replica and is not crashed. A simple example of
quorums is the following. There are <em>n</em> processes, of which fewer than
<em>n/2</em> are allowed to crash. Quorums then are all sets that have
<em><sup>[n+1]</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></em> processes.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="reliability"><b>Reliability:</b></a> The
ability of a distributed system to deliver its services even when one
or several of its software of hardware components fail. Reliability is
one of the main expected advantages of a distributed system: In a
distributed setting a machine affected by a failure can always be
replaced by another one, and not prevent the completion of a request.
An immediate and obvious consequence is that reliability relies on
redundancy of both the software components and the state, which is
achieved by <a href="#replication">replication</a>.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="replication"><b>Replication:</b></a> Maintaining
multiple copies of state on replicated machines in a distributed system
to achieve <a href="#ft">fault tolerance</a>. Replication increases
fault tolerance, availability and performance but introduces
<a href="#consistency">consistency</a> issues. When same state is
copied on different servers it should be kept consistent to give the
illusion of a single state.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="scalability"><b>Scalability:</b></a>The
ability of a system to continuously evolve in order to support a
growing amount of tasks.

<p><a class="entry" name="sm"><b>State Machine:</b></a> An abstract
machine that consists of a collection of states, a collection of
transitions between states, and a current state. A transition to a new
current state happens in response to an issued operation and produces
an output.  Transitions from the current state to the same state are
allowed, and are used to model read-only operations.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="smr"><b>State Machine Replication
(SMR):</b></a> A technique used in distributed systems to mask
failures, and <a href="#cf">crash failures</a> in particular. A
collection of <a href="#replication">replicas</a> of
a <a href="#dsm">deterministic state machine</a> are created. The
replicas are then provided with the same sequence of operations, so
they go through the same sequence of state transitions and end up in
the same state and produce the same sequence of outputs. This way
consistency between replicas is achieved. It is assumed that at least
one replica never crashes, but we do not know a priori which replica
this is.</p>

<p><a class="entry" name="synchronous"><b>Synchronous
Environment:</b></a> In a synchronous environment there are bounds on
timing. In a synchronous system there is a bound on the transmission
delay of messages, and a bound on the relative speed of
processes. This allows accurate failure detection.</p>
